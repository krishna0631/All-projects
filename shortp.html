    <p1>Linkin Park was founded by three high school friends: Mike Shinoda, Rob Bourdon, and Brad Delson.</p1><hr>
    <p2>After graduating from high school, the three began to take their musical interests more seriously, recruiting Joe Hahn, Dave "Phoenix" Farrell, and Mark Wakefield to perform in their band, then called Xero</p2><hr>
    <p3>After spending a considerable time searching for Wakefield's replacement, Xero recruited Arizona vocalist Chester Bennington, who was recommended by Jeff Blue, the vice president of Zomba Music in March 1999</p3><hr>
    <p4>The three attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California, a suburb of Los Angeles.</p1><hr>
    <p5>Though limited in resources, the band began recording and producing songs within Shinoda's makeshift bedroom studio in 1996, resulting in a four-track demo tape, entitled Xero</p2><hr>
    <p6>Bennington, formerly of a post-grunge band Grey Daze, became a standout among applicants because of the dynamic in his singing style. The band then agreed on changing their name from Xero to Hybrid Theory; the newborn vocal chemistry between Shinoda and Bennington helped revive the band, inciting them to work on new material. In 1999, the band released a self-titled extended play, which they circulated across internet chat-rooms and forums with the help of an online 'street team.</p3><hr>
